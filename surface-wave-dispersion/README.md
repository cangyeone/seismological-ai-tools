The frequency dispersion picking program can be run directly by running two scripts: 
1. The training program is used for model training 
2. The inference program is used for model inference, that is, in the training data of frequency dispersion picking, those starting with C. are energy maps and those starting with GDisp. are dispersion curves; unmarked artificial dispersion points are recorded as 0.
